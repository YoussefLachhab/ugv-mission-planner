UGV Mission Planner (GenAIâ€‘Guarded)




Turn naturalâ€‘language missions into validated, policyâ€‘compliant plans and execute them in a deterministic 2D sim. GenAI is boxed behind strict schemas and policy checks; planning and execution are deterministic.

ðŸ“… Project Timeline

Day 1 (âœ… Complete)

Public GitHub repo with proper structure.

.gitignore and .gitattributes configured.

Core docs, schemas, models, example missions/maps.

Unit tests for schema and models.

CI workflow prepared (lint, type-check, tests).

Fixed CI by adding types-jsonschema stubs for mypy.

Day 2 (Next)

Deterministic path planner (A* on 2D grid).

Simple executor (PID or direct waypoint follow).

Golden-path test cases for reproducibility.

Future Days

Day 3: GenAI NLâ†’MissionPlan parser (structured outputs).

Day 4: Policy micro-RAG + Supervisor.

Day 5: E2E pipeline, polish, demo GIF.

ðŸš€ Quickstart

python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ."[dev]"
# Install missing type stubs for CI consistency
pip install types-jsonschema
pytest
python examples\maps\generate_maps.py

ðŸ“ˆ Why This Matters

This project demonstrates System Architect thinking:

Contracts-first design (MissionPlan schema).

Separation of deterministic core from GenAI interface.

Traceability from requirements to implementation.

CI-driven development with reproducible runs.

ðŸ“… Status: Day 1 Complete

Weâ€™ve laid the groundwork. On Day 2, weâ€™ll bring the system to life with a reproducible planner and executor, paving the way for GenAI integration.
